Design and Features
Aerodynamics: The Utopia features subtle active aerodynamics designed to maximize handling and stability without relying on a large rear wing. Its airflows were refined through extensive wind tunnel testing.
Interior: The cabin blends a retro-futuristic aesthetic with advanced materials, featuring mechanical switches, skeletonized dials that reveal the internal workings, and a redesigned steering wheel machined from a single block of aluminum. Notably, it lacks a large central screen in favor of a more classic, driver-focused layout.
Suspension: It uses a forged aluminum alloy independent double-wishbone suspension system with electronically controlled shock absorbers, a design derived from the track-only Pagani Huayra R.
Exhaust: A signature of the brand, the ceramic-coated titanium quad-exhaust system is incredibly lightweight, weighing just over 6 kg (13 lbs). 
Pricing and Availability
The Pagani Utopia was presented in September 2022, with the first customer deliveries beginning in October 2023. 
MSRP: The official manufacturer's suggested retail price at launch was approximately $2,190,000 for the coupé model. The Roadster version starts at around $3.4 million.
Production: Production of the coupé is strictly limited to 99 units, all of which were quickly allocated to collectors.
Resale Value: Due to its limited nature, current resale values often exceed $3.5 million.
